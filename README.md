Problem 1. 2 weeks

For the database developed in the first semester, a Windows application must be created using the .NET framework. The application must contain at least one window (form) through which a user can manipulate data from 2 tables in a 1- n (which we will call parent table and child table). It is necessary to implement functionalities:
- to display all records of the parent table;
-when selecting a record from the parent, all records of the child table will be displayed -when selecting a record from the child, deletion or updating of data must be allowed;
- selected a record from the parent, it is allowed to add a new child record.
Data sets and data adapters will be used to communicate with the database. Any of the available controls can be used to create the window (form).
